# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis Using Pandas

## 📖 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn data from a telecom company. The aim is to identify key factors that contribute to customer churn and explore business insights through data manipulation and visualization using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## 🧠 Objectives
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Analyze churn patterns based on customer demographics and services
- Use core Pandas functions like `groupby`, `merge`, `concat`, and `apply`
- Visualize churn-related insights with plots and graphs

## 📌 Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about 7,000+ customers, including:
- Customer demographics (gender, age, senior citizen)
- Subscription details (internet service, contract, payment method)
- Tenure and billing details
- Target variable: `Churn` (Yes/No)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

| Technology        | Purpose                             |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Python**        | Data analysis & scripting           |
| **Pandas**        | Data manipulation                   |
| **NumPy**         | Numerical operations                |
| **Matplotlib**    | Visualization                       |
| **Seaborn**       | Statistical graphics                |
| **Jupyter Notebook** | Interactive data exploration    |
| **GitHub**        | Code and project version control    |

## 📈 Key Highlights
- Cleaned missing values and converted categorical columns to usable formats
- Identified churn rate by gender, contract type, payment method, and internet service
- Used `groupby()` to calculate aggregated churn rates by various segments
- Used `apply()` to create new flags and transformation logic
- Merged and concatenated DataFrames to simulate real-world ETL scenarios
- Visualized trends using countplots, pie charts, and correlation heatmaps

## 📊 Insights Extracted
- Month-to-month contracts and electronic checks are associated with higher churn
- Senior citizens and fiber optic users tend to churn more
- Longer tenure indicates customer loyalty and less churn risk
- Customers without internet service or tech support are less likely to churn

## 🧩 Future Scope
- Introduce churn prediction using machine learning models
- Build an automated Power BI dashboard or Streamlit app
- Integrate customer sentiment or feedback data for deeper analysis
